#### DL TF Meeting Notes
- Careful with literature (people don't know what they are doing)
- check citations and methods and people
- careful with training (overfitting) (maybe smaller network/small layers)
- bottlenecks
- use a pre-trained cnn (Resnets)
	- load trained model
	- good for problem with little training data
	- only fine tune it
- comparison between our own net and pre-trained net?
- make a project plan
	- include reading papers
	- know what we want to implement
- Segmentation or Classification?
- yolo-net -> segmentation
